# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
    R square value is 0.625 since its not close to 1 or -1 there is no strong correlation
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
    It is 124.3
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think this model is not very accurate because the r square value shows that there is no strong correlation. The model can improve by adding other variables that are not taken into account in this data.
